WORKDIR /appAnalysis: The React frontend runs directly in a Node.js container, using its development or production server. Docker handles isolated deployment, allowing consistent builds and port mapping without affecting the host system.

Inference: This setup demonstrates a simpler containerized deployment for frontend apps, suitable for testing or small-scale projects, though using a dedicated server like Nginx would improve performance and scalability in
