GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git for storing, sharing, and collaborating on code. Common uses:

Version control hosting: store repositories and track changes with Git.
Collaboration: pull requests, code reviews, and merge workflows.
Issue tracking and project management: create issues, milestones, and project boards.
Continuous integration / deployment: GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
Package and artifact hosting: GitHub Packages for container images, npm, NuGet, etc.
Documentation and sites: wikis and GitHub Pages for static site hosting.
Security and compliance: dependency scanning, secret scanning, and vulnerability alerts.
Git is the underlying version-control tool; GitHub adds hosting, collaboration, and automation features. Want a quick example of creating a repo or opening a pull reques
